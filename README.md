The code begins by defining constant values. The class GameScreen maintains the game state and has methods to setup and update the game, handle player input, collisions, bullet shots, and game over state.

On gameObject initialization, player and particles positions are set to a default value and the game runtime loop starts using a Timer which ensures the game logic is updated on specified periods of time.

In every frame, state update occurs. In this state update, particles and bullets coordinates are updated according to their velocities. Collision detection between bullets and particles, and player and particles is processed here. If a bullet hits a particle, both of them disappear from the game scene. If a particle collides with the player, it's game over.

When the game state is updated, the UI is redrawn and CustomPaint widget is used to draw the game scene according to the game state.

The painter used in this game, is defined in the service painter.dart which draws the player, particles, and bullets on the canvas. It determines the look of the game elements on the game scene.

When the user clicks, the calculation for bullet shooting is performed and bullet is added to the game scene.

In case of game over, an overlay screen is shown with a timer display and a restart button.

Features implemented:

1. A tracker ball that follows the mouse.
2. Particles of variable sizes scattered across the screen.
3. Moving particles with certain velocities.
4. Collision detection between particles and player, and particles and bullets.
5. Adding a cursor.
6. Support shooting on click.
7. Adding a timer which stops upon collision and displayed in the game over screen.
